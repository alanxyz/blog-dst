<blockquote>
<p>Gnome on Arch by default is really bloated, it doesn&#39;t need to be this way.</p>

<p>By default, the gnome <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/gnome/">group</a> is really bloated, it contains packages that you do not need such as <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/yelp/">yelp</a>. I think that packages like these should not be in the Gnome group but rather in <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/gnome-extra/">gnome-extra</a> as they are not needed to run Gnome. </p>

<p>I made my own list of packages that you actually need to run Gnome and alternatives to packages that need a lot of dependencies for example Nautilus which has GVFS as a strong dependency even though I doubt most people will be using it and it takes up lots of resources. </p>

<p>Instead of intalling Gnome normally like <code>pacman -S gnome</code>, I would reccomend installing Gnome with these packages so you do not install as much bloat.  </p>

<p><code>pacman -S gdm gnome-control-center gnome-keyring lxterminal gpicview-gtk3 gnome-session gnome-settings-daemon gnome-shell pcmanfm-gtk3 mutter</code></p>

<p>After installing Gnome with these options, you will have a much lighter Gnome install, like shown in this image.</p>
